\chapter{Evaluation environment}

\section{Mixin class}

\Defclass {evaluation-environment-mixin}

This class should be used by client code to create a client-specific
evaluation environment class (say \texttt{evaluation-environment})
that has a subclass of this mixin class and a subclass of
\texttt{run-time-environment} as superclasses \emph{in that order}.

\Definitarg {:parent}

This initialization argument must be provided and should be either
another evaluation environment, or a run-time environment.  In most
cases, it should be a run-time environment, i.e., an instance of the
class \texttt{run-time-environment}.

\Defgeneric {parent} {environment}

\Defmethod {parent} {(environment {\tt evaluation-environment-mixin})}

This generic function returns the environment object that was passed
as the \texttt{:parent} initialization argument when
\textit{environment} was created.
