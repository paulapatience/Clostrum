\section{Class}

\Defclass {run-time-environment}

This is the base class for run-time environments.

\section{Protocol functions}
\label{sec-run-time-protocol-functions}

We do not supply operations analogous to the standard functions
\texttt{symbol-value} and \texttt{(setf symbol-value)}.  Instead, we
supply an operation \texttt{variable-cell} that returns a
\texttt{cons} cell, in which the \texttt{car} slot contains the value
of the variable, provided that it has one.  Client code can implement
\texttt{symbol-value} and \texttt{(setf symbol-value)} by accessing
the \texttt{car} slot of this \texttt{cons} cell.

\Defgeneric {special-operator} {client environment name}

If \textit{name} has a definition as a special operator in
\textit{environment}, then that definition is returned.  The
definition is the object that was used as an argument to \texttt{(setf
  special-operator)}.  The exact nature of this object is not
specified, other than that it can not be \texttt{nil}.  If
\textit{name} does not have a definition as a special
operator in \textit{environment}, then \texttt{nil} is returned.

\Defgeneric {(setf special-operator)} {new client environment name}

Set the definition of \textit{name} to be a special operator.
The exact nature of \textit{new} is not specified, except that a
value of \texttt{nil} means that \textit{name} no longer has
a definition as a special operator in \textit{environment}.

If a value other than \texttt{nil} is given for \textit{new}, and
\textit{name} already has a definition as an ordinary
function, as a generic function, or as a macro, then an error is
signaled.  As a consequence, if it is desirable for
\textit{name} to have a definition both as a special operator
and as a macro, then the definition as a special operator should be
set first.

\Defgeneric {fdefinition} {client environment name}

This generic function is a generic version of the \commonlisp{}
function named \texttt{(setf cl:fdefinition)}.

If \textit{name} has a definition as a function in
\textit{environment}, then that definition is returned.  If no
definition exists, or a definition exists, but it is a special
operator or a macro, then \texttt{nil} is returned.

Notice that this definition implies that a \commonlisp{}
implementation can not implement \texttt{cl:fdefinition} as a simple call
to \texttt{clostrum:fdefinition}, since the \commonlisp{} function
returns \textit{true} when the name is defined as a macro or a special
operator.

\Defgeneric {(setf fdefinition)} {new-def client environment name}

This generic function is a generic version of the \commonlisp{}
function named \texttt{(setf cl:fdefinition)}.

No checks are made for the validity of \textit{new-def}.  Only the
definition of \texttt{name} as a real function (and not as a
macro or a special operator) is influenced.

If \textit{name} already names a function, then the previous
definition is lost.  If \texttt{new-def} is \texttt{nil} then
\texttt{name} will be made undefined.

If \textit{name} is a symbol and it has an associated
\texttt{setf} expander, then that \texttt{setf} expander is preserved.

\Defgeneric {macro-function} {client environment symbol}

This generic function is a generic version of the \commonlisp{}
function named \texttt{cl:macro-function}.

If \textit{symbol} has a definition as a macro in
\textit{environment}, then the corresponding macro expansion function
is returned.

If \textit{symbol} has no definition in the function namespace of
\textit{environment}, or if the definition is not a macro, then this
function returns \texttt{nil}.

\Defgeneric {(setf macro-function)} {new-def client environment symbol}

This generic function is a generic version of the \commonlisp{}
function \texttt{(setf cl:macro-function)}.

\textit{new-def} must be a macro function or \texttt{nil}.  A value of
\texttt{nil} means that the \textit{symbol} no longer has a macro
function associated with it.  If \textit{symbol} already names a
macro, then the previous definition is lost.  If \textit{symbol}
already names a function, then the an error is signaled.  If
\textit{symbol} already names a special operator, that definition is
kept.

If \textit{symbol} has an associated \texttt{setf} expander, then that
\texttt{setf} expander is preserved.

\Defgeneric {compiler-macro-function} {client environment name}

This generic function is a generic version of the \commonlisp{}
function named \texttt{cl:compiler-macro-function}.

If \textit{name} has a definition as a compiler macro in
\textit{environment}, then the corresponding compiler macro function
is returned.

If \textit{name} has no definition as a compiler macro in
\textit{environment}, then this function returns \texttt{nil}.

\Defgeneric {(setf compiler-macro-function)}\\
{new-def client environment name}

This generic function is a generic version of the \commonlisp{}
function \texttt{(setf cl:compiler-macro-function)}.

\textit{new-def} can be a compiler macro function or \texttt{nil}.
When it is a compiler macro function, then it establishes
\textit{new-def} as a compiler macro for \textit{name} and
any existing definition is lost.  A value of \texttt{nil} means that
\textit{name} no longer has a compiler macro associated with
it in \textit{environment}.

\Defgeneric {function-type} {client environment name}

This generic function returns the proclaimed type of the function
associated with \textit{name} in \textit{environment}.  If no
prior call to \texttt{(setf function-type)} has been made, then
\texttt{nil} is returned.  Otherwise, the value of the
\textit{new-type} argument to that call is returned.

\Defgeneric {(setf function-type)} {new-type client environment name}

This generic function is used to set the proclaimed type of the
function associated with \textit{name} in
\textit{environment} to \textit{new-type}.

If \textit{name} is associated with a macro or a special
operator in \textit{environment}, then an error is signaled.

Otherwise, no interpretation of the value of \textit{new-value} is
made by \sysname{}, leaving that interpretation entirely up to client
code.

\Defgeneric {function-inline} {client environment name}

This generic function returns the proclaimed inline information of the
function associated with \textit{name} in \textit{environment}.  If no
prior call to \texttt{(setf function-inline)} has been made, then
\texttt{nil} is returned.  Otherwise, the value of the
\textit{new-inline} argument to that call is returned.

\Defgeneric {(setf function-inline)}\\
{new-inline client environment name}

This generic function is used to set the proclaimed inline information
of the function associated with \textit{name} in
\textit{environment} to \textit{new-inline}.

\textit{new-inline} must have one of the values \texttt{nil},
\texttt{inline}, or \texttt{notinline}.

\Defgeneric {function-cell} {client environment name}

This generic function returns a \texttt{cons} cell.  The \texttt{cdr}
slot of the cell contains a function that, when called, signals an
\texttt{undefined-function} error.  If \texttt{name} has a
definition as a function, then the \texttt{car} slot of the \texttt{cons}
cell contains the function object.  If \texttt{name} does not
have a definition as a function, then the \texttt{car} slot contains
the same function object as the \texttt{cdr} slot.

\Defgeneric {function-description} {client environment name}

This generic function returns the function description, which is an
object that is entirely defined by client code.  Clostrum does not
provide any methods specialized to \texttt{run-time-environment}, so
client code must provide a method specialized to its specific
\texttt{client} class, and to (a subclass of)
\texttt{run-time-environment}.  It is recommended that this method
return \texttt{nil} if no function named \textit{name} exists
in \textit{environment}.

This function is typically used at compile-time in a file compiler,
and then it will be called with an instance of
\texttt{compilation-environment} rather than
\texttt{run-time-environment}.  Standard macros such as \texttt{defun}
then typically have compile-time operations that call \texttt{(setf
  function-description)} to save information about a function being
defined, and when a call to a named function is being compiled, the
compiler typically calls \texttt{function-description} to determine
whether the call corresponds to the information about the function
being called.  That way warnings can be emitted when appropriate, say
when the number of arguments of the call does not correspond to the
number of arguments that the function accepts.

Clostrum provides methods on the function \texttt{(setf
  function-description)} and \texttt{function-description},
specialized to \texttt{compilation-environment}.  The method on
\texttt{(setf function-description)} simply stores the object supplied
as an argument.  The method on \texttt{function-description} checks
whether an object has been stored, and if so, it returns that object.
If not, it returns \texttt{nil}.

\Defgeneric {constant-variable} {client environment symbol}

This function returns two values. The first value is true if
\textit{symbol} has a definition as a constant variable and
\texttt{nil} otherwise. The second value is the value of the constant
variable \textit{symbol} or \texttt{nil} if \textit{symbol} does not
have a definition as a constant variable.

\Defgeneric {(setf constant-variable)} {value client environment symbol}

This function is used in order to define \textit{symbol} as a constant
variable in \textit{environment}, with \textit{value} as its value.

If \textit{symbol} already has a definition as a special variable or
as a symbol macro in \textit{environment}, then an error is signaled.

If \textit{symbol} already has a definition as a constant variable,
and its current value is not \texttt{eql} to \textit{value}, then an
error is signaled.

\Defgeneric {special-variable} {client environment symbol}

This function returns two values. The first value is true if
\textit{symbol} has a definition as a special variable and
\texttt{nil} otherwise. The second value is the value of
\textit{symbol} as a special variable in \textit{environment}. When
the special variable is unbound, then the second value is \texttt{eq}
to the result of calling \textit{variable-unbound}.

Notice that the symbol can have a value even though this function
returns \texttt{nil} as its first value.  The first such case is when
the symbol has a value as a constant variable in \textit{environment}.
The second case is when the symbol was assigned a value as a result of
modifying the \texttt{car} slot of the \texttt{cons} cell returned by
\texttt{variable-cell} without declaring the variable as
\texttt{special}.

\Defgeneric {(setf special-variable)} {value client environment symbol init-p}

This function is used in order to define \textit{symbol} as a special
variable in \textit{environment}.

If \textit{symbol} already has a definition as a constant variable or
as a symbol macro in \textit{environment}, then an error is signaled.
Otherwise, \textit{symbol} is defined as a special variable in
\textit{environment}.

If \textit{symbol} already has a definition as a special variable, and
\textit{init-p} is \texttt{nil}, then this function has no effect.
The current value is not altered, or if \textit{symbol} is currently
unbound, then it remains unbound.

If \textit{init-p} is true, then \textit{value} becomes the new value
of the special variable \textit{symbol}.

\Defgeneric {symbol-macro} {client environment symbol}

This function returns two values.  The first value is a macro
expansion function associated with the symbol macro named by
\textit{symbol}, or \texttt{nil} if \textit{symbol} does not have a
definition as a symbol macro.  The second value is the form that
\textit{symbol} expands to as a macro, or \texttt{nil} if symbol does
not have a definition as a symbol macro.

It is guaranteed that the same (in the sense of \texttt{eq}) function
is returned by two consecutive calls to this function with the same
(in the sense of \texttt{eq})
symbol as the first argument, as long as the definition of
\textit{symbol} does not change.

\Defgeneric {(setf symbol-macro)} {expansion client environment symbol}

This function is used in order to define \textit{symbol} as a symbol
macro with the given \textit{expansion} in \textit{environment}.

If \textit{symbol} already has a definition as a constant variable, or
as a special variable, then an error of type \texttt{program-error} is
signaled.

\Defgeneric {variable-type} {client environment symbol}

This generic function returns the proclaimed type of the variable
associated with \textit{symbol} in \textit{environment}.

If \textit{symbol} has a definition as a constant variable in
\textit{environment}, then the result of calling \texttt{type-of} on
its value is returned.

If \textit{symbol} does not have a definition as a constant variable
in \textit{environment}, and no previous type proclamation has been
made for \textit{symbol} in \textit{environment}, then this function
returns \texttt{t}.

\Defgeneric {(setf variable-type)} {new-type client environment symbol}

This generic function is used to set the proclaimed type of the
variable associated with \textit{symbol} in \textit{environment}.

If \textit{symbol} has a definition as a constant variable in
\textit{environment}, then an error is signaled.

It is meaningful to set the proclaimed type even if \textit{symbol}
has not previously been defined as a special variable or as a symbol
macro, because the symbol can have a value as a result of the
\texttt{car} slot of the \texttt{cons} cell returned by
\texttt{variable-cell} having been set to some value.

Recall that the \commonlisp{} standard defines the meaning of
proclaiming the type of a symbol macro.  Therefore, it is meaningful
to call this function when \textit{symbol} has a definition as a
symbol macro in \textit{environment}.

\Defgeneric {variable-unbound} {client environment symbol}

A call to this function always succeeds.  It returns an object that indicates
that the variable is unbound.

\Defgeneric {variable-description} {client environment symbol}

This generic function returns the variable description. If no variable
description is available, then \texttt{nil} is returned. Result of this
function may be used by the compiler and for introspection.

\Defgeneric {find-class} {client environment symbol}

This generic function is a generic version of the Common Lisp function
\texttt{cl:find-class}.

If \textit{symbol} has a definition as a class in
\textit{environment}, then that class metaobject is returned.
Otherwise \texttt{nil} is returned.

\Defgeneric {(setf find-class)} {new-class client environment symbol}

This generic function is a generic version of the Common Lisp function
\texttt{(setf cl:find-class)}.

This function is used in order to associate a class with a class name
in \textit{environment}.

If \textit{new-class} is a class metaobject, then that class
metaobject is associated with the name \textit{symbol} in
\textit{environment}.  If \textit{symbol} already names a class in
\textit{environment} than that association is lost.

If \textit{new-class} is \texttt{nil}, then \textit{symbol} is no
longer associated with a class in \textit{environment}.

If \textit{new-class} is neither a class metaobject nor \texttt{nil},
then an error of type \texttt{type-error} is signaled.

\Defgeneric {class-description} {client environment symbol}

This generic function returns the class description. If no class description
is available, then \texttt{nil} is returned. Result of this function may be
used by the compiler and for introspection.

\Defgeneric {setf-expander} {client environment symbol}

This generic function returns the \texttt{setf} expander associated
with \textit{symbol} in \textit{environment}.  If \textit{symbol} is
not associated with any \texttt{setf} expander in
\textit{environment}, then \texttt{nil} is returned.

\Defgeneric {(setf setf-expander)} {new-expander client environment symbol}

This generic function is used to set the \texttt{setf} expander
associated with \textit{symbol} in \textit{environment}.

If \textit{symbol} is not associated with an ordinary function, a
generic function, or a macro in \textit{environment}, then an error is
signaled.

If there is already a \texttt{setf} expander associated with
\textit{symbol} in \textit{environment}, then the old \texttt{setf}
expander is lost.

If a value of \texttt{nil} is given for \textit{new-expander}, then
any current \texttt{setf} expander associated with \textit{symbol} is
removed.  In this case, no error is signaled, even if \textit{symbol}
is not associated with any ordinary function, generic function, or
macro in \textit{environment}.

\Defgeneric {type-expander} {client environment symbol}

This generic function returns the type expander associated with
\textit{symbol} in \textit{environment}.  If \textit{symbol} is not
associated with any type expander in \textit{environment}, then
\texttt{nil} is returned.

\Defgeneric {(setf type-expander)} {new-expander client environment symbol}

This generic function is used to set the type expander associated with
\textit{symbol} in \textit{environment}.

If there is already a type expander associated with \textit{symbol} in
\textit{environment}, then the old type expander is lost.

\Defgeneric {find-package} {client environment name}

Return the package with the name or the nickname \textit{name} in the
environment \textit{environment}.  If there is no package with that
name in \textit{environment}, then return \texttt{nil}.  Contrary to
the standard \commonlisp{} function \texttt{cl:find-package}, for this
function, \textit{name} must be a string.

\Defgeneric {(setf find-package)} {new-package client environment name}

This function is used in order to associate a package with a package
name in \textit{environment}.  The argument \textit{name} must be a
string.

If \textit{new-package} is a package object, then that package object
is associated with the name \textit{name} in
\textit{environment}.  If \textit{name} already names a package in
\textit{environment} than that association is lost.

If \textit{new-package} is \texttt{nil}, then \textit{name} is no
longer associated with a package in \textit{environment}.

If \textit{new-package} is neither a package object nor \texttt{nil},
then an error of type \texttt{type-error} is signaled.

\Defgeneric {proclamation} {client environment symbol}

This function returns a proclamation that is associated with
\textit{symbol} in \textit{environment} and that is not associated with a
variable or a function.  The value returned by this function is a list.

\Defgeneric {(setf proclamation)} {new-value client environment symbol}

This function is used to associate a new value with a declaration
\textit{symbol} in \textit{environment}. \textit{new-value} should be
a proper list.

If \textit{new-value} is \texttt{nil}, then \textit{name} association is removed.
